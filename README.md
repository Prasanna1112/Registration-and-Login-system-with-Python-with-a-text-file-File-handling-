# Registration-and-Login-system-with-Python-with-a-text-file-File-handling-

Simple login and registration practice code using python and text file instead of database.

1. You need to have your text file and your code in the same directory.
2. Simply use the code and run it.
3. If the text file does not have any values, login and forget password functionalities will not work.
4. Password validation is very basic.
5. Time complexity is not considered since this is a beginner's projext/code
